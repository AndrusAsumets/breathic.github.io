***Breathic*** is a fitness-focused Apple Watch app for endurance athletes (and more specifically for those looking to get a better understanding of their breathing) that manages breathing cycles through heart or movement activity. It does that by measuring user's heartrate or steps, which is then followed by triggering audible or haptic events indicating when it will be a good time to either breathe in or breathe out again.
\
\
\
First, after installing the app, take a look at `Controller` view where the `Source` toggle allows for basing your breathing cycles to be calculated either through hearbeats or steps. Both modes will work for running, though heartbeats will be more usable when doing either cycling, rowing, skiing, skating, etc.
\
\
\
Secondly, focus on the `Activity` toggle. Default rhythms are:
>
>*Slow* (2.2:2.2)
>\
>*Normal* (2:2)
>\
>*Fast* (1.8:1.8)
>\
>*Rest* (2.2:4.4)
>
<status@way.point>
To give you an overview, having rhythm of 1:1 while your heartbeat is on 1bps (or 60bpm) will translate to 0.5 breath cycles (in and out) per second (or 30bpm). If you are to decrease the rhythm to 2:2, then the breathing feedback will become slower by a factor of 2. If you start working out and your heartbeat goes from 60 to 120bpm, then app's breathing rate will also increase by a factor of 2.
\
\
\
Thirdly, `Feedback` toggles between ***Audio***, ***Haptic*** and ***Mute***. ***Audio*** selection also allows for changing the volume using the crown of your watch while the volume levels will also be visually portrayed back to you on the small vertical progress bar next to the ***Audio*** label.

Lastly, start a session by pressing and holding the `Session` tab. If you toggled Heartbeats from the `Source` tab (or steps and have since begun to walk), and are now wearing the watch on your hand, then it should be giving you audible/haptic feedback. If you pan the `Controller` view to left, you will see `Status` view on the right with all the relevant metrics.
\
\
\
If you chose Audio, make sure the output device is set as connected under Apple Watch's ***Settings -> Bluetooth***. In order to really make haptic events vibrant on your watch, go to ***Settings -> Sounds & Haptics*** and drag `ALERT VOLUME` all the way down to 0, then check *â€Œ**Prominent*** under `HAPTICS` tab to increase the level of vibrations.
\
\
\
After finishing a session, press and hold the `Session` tab again for either *saving* or *discarding* session metrics. Saved sessions with relevant overview data as well as a graph will appear under `Log` view that you can select from the burger menu.
\
\
\
If for some reason you made a mistake of not approving access for heartrate and/or location derived speed the first time, then you should be able to correct it by reinstalling the app once again.

Why focus on the breath, you ask? Well, according to Encyclopedia Britannica:  
>
>"Breathing, the action of moving air or water across the surface of a respiratory structure, such as a gill or lung, to facilitate respiration (the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment)."
>
In essence, breathing allows our bodies to move fresh air into our bodies. The oxygen is then moved from our lungs to blood cells, where it will react with glycose (the food we eat), resulting in adenosine triphosphate (or ATP), which will be then provide energy to our living cells for moving our muscles. It will also help to hasten the flow of our nerve impulses, which are pretty good for increasing the speed of our thoughts as our brains get more active thanks to having better access to oxygen. When reversing the cycle, breathing out again clears our bodies from all the unneccessary leftover waste gases (carbon dioxide) from the energy production that might otherwise hinder or impair our physical or mental functions should our bodies get too much of it.
