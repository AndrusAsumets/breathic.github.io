***Breathic*** is a fitness-focused Apple Watch app for endurance athletes (and more specifically for those looking to get a better understanding into their breathing) that manages breathing cycles through heart or movement activity. It does that by measuring user's heartrate, which is then followed by triggering audible or haptic events indicating when it will be a good time to either breathe in or breathe out again.
\
\
\
First, after installing the app, take a look at `Controller` view where the `Session` toggle allows for starting (and then finishing) a session. You will be greeted with selection different activities that each will have different rhythm speeds.
\
\
\
Secondly, `Playback` temporarily pauses (or resumes) the session.
\
\
\
Thirdly, `Feedback` toggles between ***Music***, ***Audio***, ***Haptic*** and ***Mute***. ***Music*** and ***Audio*** selections also allows for changing the volume using the crown of your watch while the volume levels will also be visually portrayed back to you on the small vertical progress bar next to the ***Audio*** label.

Lastly, focus on the `Activity` toggle. Tapping on the `Activity` will toggle between different rhythms. To give you an overview, having rhythm of 1:1 while your heartbeat is on 1bps (or 60bpm) will translate to 0.5 breath cycles (in and out) per second (or 30bpm). If you are to decrease the rhythm to 2:2, then the breathing feedback will become slower by a factor of 2. If you start working out and your heartbeat goes from 60 to 120bpm, then app's breathing rate will also increase by a factor of 2.
\
\
\
If you then pan the `Controller` view to left, you will see `Status` view on the right with all the relevant metrics.
\
\
\
If you chose Audio, make sure the output device is set as connected under Apple Watch's ***Settings -> Bluetooth***. In order to really make haptic events vibrant on your watch, go to ***Settings -> Sounds & Haptics*** and drag `ALERT VOLUME` all the way down to 0, then check *â€Œ**Prominent*** under `HAPTICS` tab to increase the level of vibrations.

After finishing a session, press and hold the `Session` tab again for either *saving* or *discarding* session metrics. Saved sessions with relevant overview data as well as a graph will appear under `Log` view that you can select from the burger menu. Finished sessions will also be uploaded to cloud, and can be then on accessed by scanning the QR-code under `Export` tab.
\
\
\
If for some reason you made a mistake of not approving access for heartrate and/or location derived speed the first time, then you should be able to correct it by reinstalling the app once again.

Why focus on the breath, you ask? Well, according to Encyclopedia Britannica:  
>
>"Breathing, the action of moving air or water across the surface of a respiratory structure, such as a gill or lung, to facilitate respiration (the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment)."
>
In essence, breathing allows our lungs to move fresh air into our bodies. The oxygen is then on carried into blood cells, where it will react with glycose (the food we eat), resulting in adenosine triphosphate (or ATP), which will be then provide energy to our cells for moving our muscles. It will also help to hasten the flow of our nerve impulses, which are pretty good for increasing the speed of our thoughts as our brains get more active thanks to having better access to oxygen. When reversing the cycle, breathing out again clears our bodies from all the unneccessary leftover waste gases (carbon dioxide) from the energy production that might otherwise hinder or impair our physical or mental functions should our bodies get too much of it.
